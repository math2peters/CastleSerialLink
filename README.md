# CastleSerialLink
Pythonic implementation for communication with the castle serial link (http://www.castlecreations.com/en/serial-link-010-0121-00), a device used to communicate with and control Castle Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs).

This is a small subset of spun-off code from work intended to help people communicate with ESCs via the castle serial link device. 

Examples to come soon.
